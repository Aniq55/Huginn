FDMData protocol
================

Huginn can transmit data from the flight dynamics model to an external application
that can be used to test an autopilot and any other application that can process
flight data. By default Huginn will attempt to send data to UPD port 10302 at the localhost address.

The flight data that Huginn will transmit are float values in network byte order.
The following table describes the data that are transmitted.
